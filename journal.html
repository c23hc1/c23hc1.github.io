	22/10/19- making room thing and making this journal
	25/10/19- this week we worked on the room desgins, and ideas for our projects
	25/11/19- java script ctas- I think that this was a very interesting way of learning about java script, I liked this website but I like dogs better than cats so the cats and the cat analogies were less fun to me, compared to if they were abut dogs. 
	4/2/19- I found my Journal!
	4/7/19- This week I learned how to write functions!! I learned how to write functions, with a better understanding for what a function does. I leanered that function add3, add3 would be the name of the function. The () after the name of the function is where the argument would go. After much struggle with understanding what a argument does I now understand what it does. The argument gives whatever is in it a meaning. So to use Molly's example the word Hot can have different meanings depending on what context it is in. The next part of writing a function depends on what you want your function to do. If you want a reuturn value in the console you have to add that into your code. Then you can write your code, such as h+3. The h+3 is what you want the code to do. Then make this appear in the console you have to write console.log(h+3). The function has to have curly brackets around it as well for it to run.
